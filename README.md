## Introduction

Welcome to the Dashboard Project! This dashboard provides insightful data visualizations and analytics for [specific use case or industry]. It is designed to be user-friendly and highly customizable.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs that update in real-time.
- **Customizable Widgets**: Add, remove, and configure widgets to tailor the dashboard to your needs.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user management system.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and works on all devices.
- **Exportable Reports**: Generate and download reports in various formats.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Chart.js, D3.js, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dashboard-project.git
    cd dashboard-project
    ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install backend dependencies**

    ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following:

    ```plaintext
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
    JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
    ```

5. **Start the development servers**

    ```bash
    # In the server directory
    npm run dev

    # In the client directory
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

To start using the dashboard, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You can log in with the default admin credentials or create a new account.

### Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s an example of how to add a new widget to the dashboard:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Widget } from 'react-dashboard';

const CustomWidget = () => (
    <Widget title="Custom Widget">
        <p>This is a custom widget content.</p>
    </Widget>
);

export default CustomWidget;


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
